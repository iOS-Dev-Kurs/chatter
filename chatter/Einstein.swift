 Important: please add a default case to your switch-Statements when asking for the Message-type (this will not be executed :))
 
 How to Work with Topics?
 If you want to create a topic go to Chatter.swift and add the Topic in the enum (with Description!)
 In the initializer of your chatter give possibleTopics a list of toppings your chatter want to talk about. (by default none)
 If you want to give individual answers for a ask to change the topic you can write them to sayNoToTopicChangeWith and sayYesToTopicChangeWith
 You can create your own Question to ask someone to change the topic. The Last word is computed and is the name of the topic.
 Now in your functions nextMessage() and responseForMessage you can ask the variable theCurrentTopic which Toping is now. With this you can adjust your answers to the topic.
